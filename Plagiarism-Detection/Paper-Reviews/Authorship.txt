A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Computer Software Source Code Authorship Analysis.

* Use the subjective nature of the elements of authorship, like source comments.
  ** Idea is that the individual will have characteristics that differentiate his product from others.
* Overcomes small datasets that cannot be utilized for Author discrimination or similarity detection.
* Constructs Author profile - size, structure, layout, expression, negate standard way to naming variables.
* Fuzzyvar measures - Braces, indentation, identifiers, utility variables, spelling errors, comments for code.
* Correlate fuzzy metrics, this will show similarity.


Plagiarism in natural and programming languages: an overview of current tools and technologies.
* Proving plagiarism is a hard thing, as even if its copied verbatim, we need proof.
* So, instead of checking for the common stuff, check for common errors.
* Changing comments, data types, identifiers, redundant statements or variables, the structure of selection statements, combining copied and original program statements.
* Any detection system should allow sensitivity to be adjusted
* Preprocess the tokens
  ** map all synonyms/hyper/hyponyms to the base parent, like so: strncmp -> strcmp
* Takes a look at the various approaches by different tools and their success rate.
