Ideas:
* Build a user profile based on previous levels
* Make sure that semantic equivalence of commands is taken into account. e.g. vim, nano, emacs, less, cat when displaying data, and also the difference of more complex commands: fuser -k, ps aux | grep | kill


Objectives:
* Must be able to differentiate semantics of commands, and cluster them together if they achieve similar things without much difference.


* Good to haves
* Should be able to refine the granularity
