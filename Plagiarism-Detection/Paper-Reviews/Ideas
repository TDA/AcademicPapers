Ideas:
* Build a user profile based on previous levels -- Intrinsic detection, first stage? If it mismatches way too much (threshold?), then compare with other student levels.
* Maybe detect if user changes their stylistic choices of editors, commands, etc.

* Compare the commands used by different students and figure out similarities in the usage.
* Make sure that semantic equivalence of commands is taken into account. e.g. vim, nano, emacs, less, cat when displaying data, and also the difference of more complex commands: fuser -k, ps aux | grep | kill

* Track movements across levels, are `x` users always moving through the levels in a pattern. Does `a` moving 1 level higher mean `b`, `c`, etc move too?

* Command shuffling and Semantical command variation - Generate Testing datasets with automatic plagiarism generator?


Objectives:
* Must be able to differentiate semantics of commands, and cluster them together if they achieve similar things without much difference.
* Must be able to perform both intrinsic and external plagiarism detection with enough data.


Good to haves:
* Should be able to refine the granularity
